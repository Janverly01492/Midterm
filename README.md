####  Delete Confirmation Alert

This screenshot shows the **confirmation prompt** that appears when a user attempts to delete a sales record.  
The alert message `"Are you sure?"` ensures that users confirm their action before permanently deleting any data.  
This feature helps prevent accidental deletions and maintains data integrity within the sales management system.
